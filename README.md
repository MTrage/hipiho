## Help
#### When you start hipiho for the first time, you will be asked for the PI-Hole IP, the port and whether you want the output to be slightly offset or a bit more colourful!

If you make a mistake or the Pi-Hole does not respond to your request, you will be asked again if you want to enter the configuration data again.

If you want to create a new configuration file for the query, you can do this with the option "-n".

If you want to use Borders or IloveCandy, simply enter "yes" in the respective question during setup!

# Borders=no & IloveCandy=no
